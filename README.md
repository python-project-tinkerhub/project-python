   How To Run:
   
   for user:
   1. Before using this website you should create an account through the provided link, where you will be giving your name, email id, twitter id etc.
   2.Then you must login from the index page using username and password which was created initially. This will take you to dashboard.
   3.Here you will be provided with a bot name. The thing you should do is just mention this bot name in your tweets which must be saved.
   4.After giving all your tweets you can click the 'pull tweet list' button which is provided in the dashboard.
   5.That's all now you will receive all your tweets as a text file.
   
   for admin:
   1.The program tracks the tweets from user by using API key.
   2.When the user creates an account in the website using twitter id etc it will be saved in the DB.
   3.When the user log in into the dashboard it uses the twitter id which was collected before from database.
   4.When the user clicks the download button the program gets executed and the program writes the current tweets in a text file and this text file will be made available      to download for user.
   5.The python file containing API keys are 'ignored' for security issues in GitHub repo.
